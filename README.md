# Hi, I'm Alia! 👋

I’m a **2024 Software Developer Graduate** excited to begin my professional journey in tech. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained a solid foundation in software development, problem-solving, and the art of creating scalable applications. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills to solve real-world challenges.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 I recently graduated with a degree in **Computer Science** (or related field) and I'm eager to apply what I’ve learned in a professional setting.
- 💻 I enjoy building software that **makes a difference**, whether it's a small tool that improves productivity or a larger system that solves complex problems.
- 🛠️ My main interests are in **full-stack development**, **cloud computing**, and **data structures**. I’m particularly drawn to writing clean, efficient code that can be scaled and maintained easily.
- 🌱 I’m always learning and currently diving deeper into **cloud technologies** and **machine learning**. I also love exploring **DevOps practices** and the latest in **automation** to streamline development workflows.
- 🤝 Collaboration is one of my favorite parts of software development. I thrive in environments where team members work together to create something greater than what one person could achieve alone.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Work With

I’ve gained experience with a variety of technologies during my academic and personal projects:

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Django, Flask, Node.js, Spring Boot
- **Tools & Tech:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- **Cloud Platforms**: I’m diving deeper into cloud providers like AWS and GCP, learning to build scalable applications with cloud-native services.
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring the world of ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and how they can be applied to real-world problems.
- **DevOps & Automation**: I’m getting familiar with tools like Docker and Jenkins to automate processes and improve development workflows.
